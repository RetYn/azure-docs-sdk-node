  **Off**: Autoscaler never changes pod resources but provides recommendations.
  \

  **Initial**: Autoscaler only assigns resources on pod creation and doesn't
  change them during the lifetime of the pod. \

  **Recreate**: Autoscaler assigns resources on pod creation and updates pods
  that need further scaling during their lifetime by deleting and recreating. \

  **Auto**: Autoscaler chooses the update mode. Autoscaler currently does the
  same as Recreate. In the future, it may take advantage of restart-free
  mechanisms once they are available.
